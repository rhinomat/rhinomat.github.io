                <p>
                    I'm a designer, builder, nerd and problem-solver. Whatever 
                    the activity may be like gaming, programming, or modeling 
                    in Blender, I enjoy discovering and analyzing how things 
                    operate in order to better understand them. I have always 
                    had an interest in computer science. whether it be networking, 
                    computer graphics, web development or learning a new quirk of 
                    Linux, I always find something new to learn and take with me. 
                    <br><br> I'm very enthusiastic about creating and designing 
                    things that might make the world a more interesting place. 
                    Right now, I'm finishing my Computer Science degree at 
                    Portland State University, set to graduate in June 2026.
